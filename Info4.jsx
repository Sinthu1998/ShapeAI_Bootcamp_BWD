      <p>
        Machu Picchu is an Incan citadel set high in the Andes Mountains in
        Peru, above the Urubamba River valley. Built in the 15th century and
        later abandoned, itâ€™s renowned for its sophisticated dry-stone walls
        that fuse huge blocks without the use of mortar, intriguing buildings
        that play on astronomical alignments and panoramic views. Its exact
        former use remains a mystery.
